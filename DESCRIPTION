Title: Cluster-Robust (Sandwich) Variance Estimators with Small-Sample
    Corrections
Version: 0.2.1
Authors@R: person("James", "Pustejovsky", email = "jepusto@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Provides several cluster-robust variance estimators
    (i.e., sandwich estimators) for ordinary and weighted least squares linear
    regression models. Several adjustments are incorporated to improve small-
    sample performance. The package includes functions for estimating the variance-
    covariance matrix and for testing single- and multiple-contrast hypotheses
    based on Wald test statistics. Tests of single regression coefficients use
    Satterthwaite or saddle-point corrections. Tests of multiple-contrast hypotheses 
    use an approximation to Hotelling's T-squared distribution.  Methods are
    provided for a variety of fitted models, including lm(), plm() (from package 'plm'),
    gls() and lme() (from 'nlme'), robu() (from 'robumeta'), and rma.uni() and rma.mv() (from
    'metafor').
