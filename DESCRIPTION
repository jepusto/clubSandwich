Description: Provides several cluster-robust variance estimators (i.e.,
    sandwich estimators) for ordinary and weighted least squares linear regression
    models, including the bias-reduced linearization estimator introduced by Bell
    and McCaffrey (2002) 
    <http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/12-001-x/2002002/article/9058-eng.pdf> and 
    developed further by Pustejovsky and Tipton (2017) 
    <DOI:10.1080/07350015.2016.1247004>. The package includes functions for estimating
    the variance- covariance matrix and for testing single- and multiple-
    contrast hypotheses based on Wald test statistics. Tests of single regression
    coefficients use Satterthwaite or saddle-point corrections. Tests of multiple-
    contrast hypotheses use an approximation to Hotelling's T-squared distribution.
    Methods are provided for a variety of fitted models, including lm() and mlm
    objects, glm(), ivreg() (from package 'AER'), plm() (from package 'plm'), gls()
    and lme() (from 'nlme'), lmer() (from `lme4`), robu() (from 'robumeta'), and 
    rma.uni() and rma.mv() (from 'metafor').
