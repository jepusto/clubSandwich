clubSandwich 0.5.0
=======================
* Major update to Wald_test() 
    * Wald_test() now uses new helper functions constrain_zero(), constrain_equal(), and constrain_pairwise() to specify constraint matrices.
    * Wald_test() gains an argument tidy. When TRUE, results for a list of tests will be tidied into a single data.frame. 
    * Output of Wald_test now includes both numerator and denominator degrees of freedom.
* Corrected bug in methods for plm objects, which occurred when "within" models included cluster-level interactions. Previously main effects of cluster-level variables were not getting dropped from model_matrix.plm().


clubSandwich 0.4.2
=======================
* Updated and streamlined unit tests for R 4.0.0.

clubSandwich 0.4.1
=======================
* Updated unit tests to satisfy obscure CRAN checks.

clubSandwich 0.4.0
=======================
* Added methods for lmerMod objects fitted by lme4::lmer().
* Updated internals to use inherits() instead of checking class() directly.

clubSandwich 0.3.5
=======================
* Added t statistics to output of coef_test(). 
* Fixed a bug in get_index_order(), an internal function used with plm objects. Previously, the function assumed that both individual and time indices were specified in the plm call. The new function works even when zero or one indices are specified.

clubSandwich 0.3.3
=======================
* impute_covariance_matrix() now drops unobserved factor levels.
* updated method for handling residuals from rma.uni and rma.mv objects, for consistency with metafor 2.1-0.

clubSandwich 0.3.2
=======================
* Added conf_int() to provide easy cluster-robust confidence intervals.
* Added examples to documentaiton for conf_int() and coef_test().

clubSandwich 0.3.1
=======================
* Added "coefs" option to coef_test() to allow testing of subsets of coefficients.
* Updated tests to use carData instead of car package.

clubSandwich 0.3.0
=======================
* Added methods for ivreg objects.
* Added methods for mlm objects.
* Updated residuals_CS.plm to account for changes in plm 1.6-6.

clubSandwich 0.2.3
=======================
* Updated methods for plm objects to account for changes in plm 1.6-6.
* Added methods for glm objects.
* Added documentation of "type" options in vcovCR().
* Added examples for all vcovCR() methods.
* Provide facility to cluster at higher level than highest random effects for lme and gls objects.
* Added impute_covariance_matrix() utility function for multivariate meta-analysis.

clubSandwich 0.2.2
=======================
* Added bread() methods for all supported model classes.
* vcovCR() is now calculated using bread(), and carries attributes for bread, est_mat, and adjustment matrices.
* vcovCR() gains a 'form' argument to obtain just the meat of the sandwich, or to use a user-specified bread matrix. 
* Refactored internal functions for degrees of freedom calculation to improve speed and memory usage.
* Bug fixes:
  - updated nobs.plm method to handle first-differenced models
  

clubSandwich 0.2.1
=======================

* First version released on CRAN.
