## Resubmission

This release provides enhanced options for hypothesis testing within the existing functions Wald_test(), coef_test(), and linear_contrast().

Please note that the DESCRIPTION file includes a citation to Bell and McCaffrey (2002), but unfortunately that article does not have a DOI; I have included a URL instead.
